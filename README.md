# About Beatblock Utilities
Beatblock Utilities is a collection of external Windows Forms apps to help with Beatblock custom map creation.

# How to install
## If you don't want to install anything:
- Download the .exe files larger than 100MB. <br />-> They already come with all dependencies that are needed for them to run.

## For smaller file sizes:
- Download the smaller .exe files and try to run them to see if you maybe already have the framework installed.
- If you don't, Windows should automatically suggest a download link for the correct version.
